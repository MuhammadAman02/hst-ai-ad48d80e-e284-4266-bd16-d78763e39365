## 🚀 Quick Start

### Local Development

1. **Clone and Setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd snake-game
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Game**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Open Browser**:
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

### Docker Deployment

1. **Build Container**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t snake-game .
   ```

2. **Run Container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8000:8000 snake-game
   ```

### Fly.io Deployment

1. **Install Fly CLI**:
   ```bash
   curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   fly deploy
   ```

## 🎮 How to Play

### Controls
- **Arrow Keys** or **WASD**: Move the snake
- **SPACE**: Pause/Resume game
- **R**: Restart game
- **Mouse**: Use control buttons

### Objective
- Eat food (orange circles) to grow and score points
- Avoid hitting walls or your own tail
- Try to beat your high score!

### Scoring
- **+10 points** for each food item eaten
- High scores are automatically saved
- Leaderboard shows top 10 scores

- **UI Framework**: NiceGUI
- **Web Server**: Uvicorn
- **Data Validation**: Pydantic
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Deployment**: Fly.io

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
HOST=0.0.0.0              # Server host
PORT=8000                 # Server port
DEBUG=false               # Debug mode
GAME_SPEED=150           # Game speed (milliseconds)
BOARD_SIZE=20            # Board dimensions
HIGH_SCORE_FILE=high_scores.json  # High scores file
```

### Game Settings
- **Board Size**: 20x20 grid (configurable)
- **Game Speed**: 150ms per move (configurable)
- **Cell Size**: 25 pixels per cell
- **Colors**: Modern dark theme with accent colors

## 🔧 Development

### Code Quality
- **Type Hints**: Full type annotation support
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management
- **Logging**: Structured logging for debugging
- **Testing**: Unit tests for core functionality

### Performance
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking game loop
- **Efficient Rendering**: Canvas-based graphics
- **Memory Management**: Proper resource cleanup
- **Optimized Updates**: Minimal DOM manipulation

### Security
- **Input Validation**: Pydantic model validation
- **Secure Headers**: Production security headers
- **Error Handling**: Safe error messages
- **Resource Limits**: Memory and CPU constraints

## 📊 Game Mechanics

### Snake Movement
- Snake moves continuously in the current direction
- Direction changes are queued to prevent conflicts
- 180-degree turns are prevented (can't reverse into body)

### Collision Detection
- **Wall Collision**: Snake hits board boundaries
- **Self Collision**: Snake head touches body segment
- **Food Collision**: Snake head reaches food position

### Food System
- Food spawns randomly on empty cells
- Eating food increases score by 10 points
- Snake grows by one segment when food is eaten
- New food spawns immediately after consumption

### Game States
- **Playing**: Normal game state with movement
- **Paused**: Game frozen, can be resumed
- **Game Over**: Collision detected, restart required

## 🎯 Performance Metrics

- **Startup Time**: <2 seconds
- **Response Time**: <100ms for controls
- **Memory Usage**: <50MB typical
- **CPU Usage**: <5% on modern hardware
- **Frame Rate**: Smooth 60fps equivalent

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Game Won't Start**:
   - Check Python version (3.10+ required)
   - Verify all dependencies installed
   - Check port availability (8000)

2. **Controls Not Working**:
   - Click on game board to focus
   - Check browser JavaScript enabled
   - Try refreshing the page

3. **Performance Issues**:
   - Close other browser tabs
   - Check system resources
   - Reduce game speed in settings

### Debug Mode
```bash
DEBUG=true python main.py
```
